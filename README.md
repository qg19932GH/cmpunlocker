## Proof of Concept

Below are memory and performance results after applying the unlock:

## Requirements

- Linux (x86-64 or aarch64)
- Root access
- NVIDIA CMP 170HX (8GB or 10GB)
- **nvidia-open 610.43.03 or 610.43.02 already installed** (libs + firmware)
- Kernel headers matching the running kernel (`linux-headers-$(uname -r)` / `kernel-devel`)
- Secure Boot disabled (patched modules are unsigned)
- Network access on first install (downloads matching stock `open-gpu-kernel-modules` sources)

---

## Install

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

Then perform a cold reboot (full power off, then boot). The correct memory geometry is selected automatically from the PCI device ID (`0x20C2` = 8GB physical -> ~63.25GiB visible, `0x2082` = 10GB -> 40GB).

### HBM Memory overclock
<details>
<summary> HBM Memory overclock </summary>

`--mclk-ndiv=N` sets the FBPA PLL multiplier; the resulting clock is `N * 27` MHz. Any VBIOS works, on both `0x20C2` (8GB) and `0x2082` (10GB).

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --mclk-ndiv=70   # 1890 MHz
```

| NDIV | Frequency | Notes                           |
|------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| 45   | 1215 MHz  | Stock 10gb                      |
| 60   | 1620 MHz  | Works on ~60% of 10gb cards     |
| 54   | 1458 MHz  | Stock 8gb 250w vbios            |
| 64   | 1728 MHz  | Stock 8gb 300w vbios            |
| 70   | 1890 MHz  | Works on ~60% of 8gb cards      |
| 73   | 1971 MHz  | Usually only on lucky 8gb cards |

Values below stock downclock the card, which is the way to stabilise a card that fails at stock.

Without the flag the overclock is compiled out entirely. The multiplier is compiled into the modules, so changing it means re-running `install.sh`. In a mixed 8GB+10GB system the same multiplier lands on every card.

If a value turns out to be unstable - reinstall without `--mclk-ndiv` (or run `./remove.sh`) from a working state.

### IOMMU

<details> 
<summary> IOMMU </summary>
The installer adds `iommu=pt` (passthrough) to the kernel command line by default — it has negligible overhead and is required for VM passthrough. IOMMU must also be enabled in BIOS (VT-d on Intel, AMD-Vi / SVM on AMD).

To skip IOMMU configuration:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --no-iommu
```

</details>

### Surviving Kernel Updates (Anti-rollback)

<details> 
<summary> Surviving Kernel Updates </summary>

The patched modules are built against one specific kernel. Without help, the first kernel update leaves the card on the stock driver — reporting 8GB instead of ~63.25GiB — or on nouveau. The installer wires the rebuild into the kernel update path by default, so this does not happen.

A new kernel triggers a rebuild through the package manager hook for your distro, **before** you reboot:

| Distro | Hook |
|---|---|
| Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE | `/etc/kernel/install.d/95-cmpunlocker.install` |
| Debian, Ubuntu, HiveOS | `/etc/kernel/postinst.d/cmpunlocker` |
| Arch | `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/95-cmpunlocker.hook` |

`cmpunlocker-rebuild.service` is the safety net for what hooks cannot see — a hand-built kernel, a restored snapshot, or a hook that ran before the kernel headers were unpacked. It holds the boot until the patched modules exist, because a rig that silently comes up at 8GB is worse than one slow boot. It gives up after three consecutive failures rather than delaying every boot forever.

Two more things keep the stock driver from winning:

- `/etc/depmod.d/cmpunlocker.conf` makes the patched modules outrank the stock ones. The distro driver is rebuilt on every kernel update too, into `extra/` (akmod) or `updates/dkms/` (dkms), right next to ours.
- `nvidia-fallback.service` is masked and nouveau is blacklisted, so a driver that fails to load does not hand the card to nouveau.

**The NVIDIA packages are pinned to their installed version.** A driver upgrade past the versions in `driver/VERSION` makes every later rebuild fail, which is the rollback this is meant to prevent. This covers the GSP firmware the driver actually loads, from `/lib/firmware/nvidia/<driver-version>/`, which ships in the driver package itself.

GPU *firmware* packages (`nvidia-gpu-firmware` and friends) are deliberately left unpinned — they belong to `linux-firmware`, and holding them back can wedge system upgrades on a dependency conflict. They are also no longer able to affect the unlock: the optional Booter payload override is read from `/var/lib/cmpunlocker/dmem.bin` rather than from `/lib/firmware/nvidia/ga100/gsp/`, a directory that firmware updates add files to and that no amount of pinning could safely protect.

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --no-pin       # allow driver upgrades, accept the risk
sudo ./install.sh --no-persist   # manage rebuilds yourself
```

Checking on it:

```bash
systemctl status cmpunlocker-rebuild
sudo /usr/lib/cmpunlocker/pin-packages.sh status
cat /var/log/cmpunlocker/rebuild-$(uname -r).log
sudo /usr/lib/cmpunlocker/rebuild.sh          # rebuild for the running kernel by hand
```

To take a pinned driver upgrade: `sudo /usr/lib/cmpunlocker/pin-packages.sh unpin`, upgrade, then re-run `install.sh` (which re-pins). If the new driver version is not in `driver/VERSION`, the build will refuse it.

Everything above is undone by `./remove.sh --yes`.

## Verify

After install and cold reboot:

```bash
# Memory — 8GB card should show about 64768 MiB, 10GB card 40960 MiB
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,memory.total,pci.bus_id --format=csv

# Unlock logs
sudo dmesg | grep CMPUNLOCK

# P2P read matrix (multi-GPU, only with --p2p) — should be OK, not GNS
nvidia-smi topo -p2p r

# Link topology (multi-GPU) — PIX / PHB / SYS depending on how the GPUs are wired
nvidia-smi topo -m
```

### Benchmark

SM count, memory size and bandwidth, PCIe link speed, tensor core throughput (TF32/BF16/INT8), SM clock, and hardware features (NVENC/NVDEC):

```bash
./benchmark/nvidia_bench             # GPU 0, auto-sized iterations
./benchmark/nvidia_bench 1           # explicit GPU index
./benchmark/nvidia_bench 0 50        # explicit iteration count
./benchmark/nvidia_bench --csv       # one header line + one data line
./benchmark/nvidia_bench --help      # all options
```

A pre-built x86-64 binary is included. On aarch64 (or to rebuild), install the CUDA toolkit and build from source:

```bash
cd benchmark && nvcc -O3 -o nvidia_bench nvidia_bench.cu -lnvidia-ml -ldl \
  -gencode arch=compute_80,code=sm_80 && strip nvidia_bench
```

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo ./remove.sh --yes
```

Then perform a cold reboot (full power off, then boot).

This removes the patched modules from disk, undoes the kernel-update hooks, releases the package pin, and rebuilds the initramfs. The driver already running in memory is left alone — the card comes up on the stock driver at the next boot, which is the safe order.

`--reload` swaps the running driver for the stock one immediately instead of waiting for the reboot. It is off by default because loading the stock `nvidia-drm` against a CMP 170HX can wedge the machine: the card has no usable display engine, and the kernel keeps answering pings while userspace stops making progress. There is no reason to take that risk during an uninstall you are going to reboot from anyway.
